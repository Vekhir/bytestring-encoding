These library provides converter between `ByteString` and `Text` based
on `GHC.IO.Encoding`.
Compared to the [text-icu](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-icu)
package, it has only limited feature and platform dependent, but it is
light-weight and consistent with conversion by `System.IO`.

## Limitations and Known issues

* There are some cases that conversion can produce incomplete results due to the problem of `GHC.IO.Encoding` API.
  see https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/15553 for details.
